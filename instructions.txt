The forms project – due date TBA

1.	Your form 
You will in groups of 3 or 4 consider the following:

What would a registration page for an airline frequent flyer program look like?

You done some forms with personal information already but there will be other kinds of information you might want to add.

The form should certainly include:
      Family and given names.(both required)
      Home address including a drop down list for states and/or Canadian 
                  provinces; required) & Country (U.S. or Canada.  Presumably
                  there are other pages for other countries this airline serves.
                 (Please find the drop-down lists of states & provinces online.)
                  When validating you should note that Canadian postal codes
                  follow a different format from U.S. zip codes.
      Date of birth – please use drop down lists or a date finder (required)
      Telephone number(s) 
      Radio buttons to choose a salutation (Mr./ Ms./ Dr./Rev./and n/a)
       An email (required)
      Check boxes for at least three other question of your own choosing that 
             you think an airline might include.  For example, (do participants want 
             text messages for their bookings? If so what phone number) you 
            might add for enhanced functionality. Do they have seat preferences?
            etc.
      A password (you decide on how secure) and confirm password- please
            use the password type so that the characters are hidden.
     At least one field which asks users to enter a number (not from a drop-
           down list & which you will validate as a number.  It is fine to also
           have min and max allowable values.)


Design your form as follows:

•	Decide what other questions you should ask

•	Group your questions and use a fieldset and legend to show the user how they are grouped.

•	Decide how to inform blind users about required fields

•	Your form should be nicely laid out and include an airline logo or something somewhat appropriate for a frequent flyer club.

2.	Validating your form

Having designed your form you should make a list of the items you want to verify and what you want to check.   

Next start writing your validating function – which will do one of the following:
a.	If some item is not filled in correctly then you will show the user a message which pinpoints the item or items that needs to be fixed.

You may choose to highlight the field name in red, or you may have messages which appear and disappear with error messages.  (Think about the hidden and visibility properties).

Think about blind users.

Return false.


b.	If everything validates, then be sure any previous error messages are gone, an appropriate message is alerted to the user,  and return true.

c.	NOTE: Think about what you need to do to remove the error messages if a form first doesn’t validate and then does.
      
               As you write this code, you will want to make use of the validation 
               functionality which is built into HTML5 for the email type, but b/c 
               telephone numbers are so different world-wide, you will need to choose 
               a pattern and a regex for North American phones.

                You have  some links on form validation, including what you read for 
                Assignment 2. For your conveneience they are reproduced below:

Finally, for more advanced vaidation issues, there is a ValidityState, which you can access with your JavaScript.  You can learn about it at:

Skills need for this project:
•	Deciding on what information and questions should go on the form.
•	Grouping the items and choosing fieldsets and legends
•	Creating an appropriate visual design for the form.
•	Coding the form, including labels
•	Making sure the form is accessible
•	Broad design of the validating function
•	Deciding how to handle incorrect or missing input (i.e. an invalid entry)
•	Detailed coding the validating function for 
o	checkboxes and radio buttons
o	required fields
o	credit card numbers
o	dates (e. g. no Feb. 30)
o	text boxes and nunbers
•	Making sure that if there is invalid input which is corrected then no error messages show.
•	Keeping the project on schedule.
•	Maintaining any project notes and keeping versions controlled.
•	Team spirit!
